    Executes a command and returns the exit code, with an option to abort the
    script if the command fails.

     - `command`: string that represents the command you want to run. It can be
       any valid command that can be executed in the command line
     - `abort_on_error`: boolean flag that determines whether the script should
       abort if the command fails. If `abort_on_error` is set to `True`, the
       script will print an error message and exit with a status code of 1 if
       the previous command returns a non-zero, defaults to `True`

    executed.

    validity, or just the single command
